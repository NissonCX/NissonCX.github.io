I'm a computer science student at Chongqing University with a strong passion for backend engineering and distributed systems.

When I'm not coding, you can find me solving algorithm problems or reading about system architecture.

**Current focus**:  
- Microservices with Spring Cloud  
- Message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)  
- Database optimization  

Feel free to reach out!
